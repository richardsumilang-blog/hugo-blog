Unfortunately you can't on a [Panasonic VT25][1]. Someone managed to forget
about that feature on the Netflix app. Weird because it's there for YouTube,
Pandora, Amazon, etc... The only way you can is by resetting your TV to the
factory settings and starting from scratch. You're wrong if you think you can
just log into your Netflix account and click the unlink all devices link from
your profile. On the plus side... Never mind, there is no plus side.

I would highly recommend using another device such as a PlayStation, Roku, or
anything else to view your Netflix since they are far better. The Viera Cast
implementation is also lacking a search feature.

If you want to go ahead reset your TV to the factory settings then be sure to
back up the following settings:

1. Network Settings
2. Picture Settings
3. Viera Cast app arrangements
