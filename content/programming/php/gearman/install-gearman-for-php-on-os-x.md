Setup [Gearman][1] for PHP with OS X 10.9.2 Mavericks using [brew][2]. This
requires [libgearman][3] and the easiest way to get it is probably to
[install gearman]({{< relref "install-gearman-on-os-x.md" >}}) through brew, of course.

It might also be worth noting that this works for me with the brew build of PHP.
It will probably work for the distribution that comes with OS X but I haven't
tested.

<pre><code class="language-bash" title="Install">sudo pecl install gearman</code></pre>

Next copy the following contents into `/usr/local/etc/php/5.4/conf.d/ext-gearman.ini`
(or wherever your extension config directory is):

<pre><code class="language-ini" title="Extension configuration">[gearman]
extension="/usr/local/Cellar/php54/5.4.13/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20100525/gearman.so"</code></pre>

Restart apache:

<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apachectl restart</code></pre>

That's it. Test to make sure it's loaded with `phpinfo`.
