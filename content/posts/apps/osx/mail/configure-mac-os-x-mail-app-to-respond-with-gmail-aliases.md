Mail application on OS X to respond to the emails using the appropriate alias.

If you haven't already, [configure your Mail app][2] to your gmail account.

Finally, to configure your aliases, go back into your account settings in the
Mail app and comma separate each alias under the **Email Address:** field. It's
