Using a password manager adds numerous of security benefits. The key feature
being strong unique passwords for each application you use. Two of the most
popular password managers are [LastPass][1] and [1Password][2]. The main
difference is LastPass syncs to all your devices by storing your vault on their
servers. 1Password syncs to all your devices via Dropbox and does not save your
vault to any other servers. They are both good and whichever you choose to use
will be up to you.

company's as well. Read more about [LastPass multifactor options][6] and
