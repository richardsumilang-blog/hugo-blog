I kept getting the following message when I tried running `svn` commands on my
computer. I tried to accept the certificate permanently with no luck:

<pre>Error validating server certificate for 'https://subversion.assembla.com:443':
 - The certificate is not issued by a trusted authority. Use the
   fingerprint to validate the certificate manually!
Certificate information:

I noticed that the subversion files were owned by the `root` user when
inspecting the files on my computer. I'm not sure how this happened but it can
easily be fixed with the `chown` command.
