The iOS Simulator is obviously a must have tool for development. Web development
is no exception but Apple makes you jump through a few hoops (Xcode) to get to
it. Luckily you can run it as a standalone application.

Copy this command on your terminal to create a symbolic link to it:

<pre><code class="language-bash" title="Symbolic Link to iOS Simulator" >ln -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/Applications/iPhone\ Simulator.app /Applications/iPhone\ Simulator.app</code></pre>

It starts off ridiculously big but you can shrink it down by going to *Window*
-&gt; *Scale* -&gt; *50%*.
