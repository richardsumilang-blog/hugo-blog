Title: Bottlehead S.E.X. 2.1 Unboxed
SubTitle: Impedance Switch and C4S Parts Revealed
---

There you have it. All the parts that I'll be assembling for the Bottlehead
S.E.X. version 2.1. The parts in the image include the impedance switch and the
C4S components. To the far left, there is a bag I didn't bother unraveling
because it is mainly little screws and bolts that felt easy to lose.

### Build Order

I will do incremental builds. This way I can test the quality of a build on it's
own before adding additional components. This is a good practice I follow in
daily software development and has proved helpful in debugging. The order will
be as follows:

1. S.E.X. kit.
2. Impedance switch installation.
3. C4S Upgrade.

### Customizations

Before I dive directly into the build I will need to do a few customizations. I
figure it will be easier to do this now before the parts are assembled because
they will not be easily accessible later. The order will be as follows:

1. Bottlehead PC-3 painting.
2. Sanding and varnishing the wood frame.
3. Nickeling metal components.
