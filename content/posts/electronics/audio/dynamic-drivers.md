A *dynamic driver*, sometimes referred to as a "moving coil" driver is the most
common driver found in headphones. It is the same technology found in speakers
around your home, but on a much smaller scale. This type of driver
consists of alternating magnetic fields powered by a tiny wire coil (or a
"voice coil"). As the current changes based on the sound playback, the coil
reacts with the magnetic field and the lightweight diaphragm rapidly compresses
and decompresses the air by pulling the diaphragm in and out from the ring
within the driver to create the sound you hear.

Dynamic drivers produce good bass with a decent amount of sound pressure without
the need for using excess power. Dynamic drivers are capable of producing a full
range of sound for the average listener.
