You may notice musicians typically wearing an IEM during a live performance.
This is to listen to a custom set of instruments.

Other names for IEMs are In-Ear-Canalphone, canalphone, or ear-canal headphone.
People believe the acronym IEM became the popular replacement for canalphones
with the iPod generation.

IEMs are sometimes mistakenly called earbuds. The main difference being earbuds
are worn in the opening of the ear. They are not designed to sit in the ear
canal.
