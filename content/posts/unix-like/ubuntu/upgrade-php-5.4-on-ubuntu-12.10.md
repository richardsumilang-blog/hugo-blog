PHP 5.4 is not in the standard Ubuntu 12.10 repositories. We will use a
backported version of PHP 5.4 by configuring a 3rd party PPA. Open a terminal
and run the following commands:

<!--more-->

<pre><code class="language-bash" title="Installation Instructions">sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php5-oldstable
sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install php5</code></pre>


If you compiled or installed any PHP extensions via `pecl` then you will need to
reinstall those too. Development packages must be upgraded before you run `pecl`
or `phpize`:

<pre><code class="language-bash" title="Development packages">sudo apt-get install php-pear php5-dev</code></pre>

Test if everything is ok by running `phpinfo();` from a PHP script on your
web-server and `php -i` from your terminal.

Enjoy!
