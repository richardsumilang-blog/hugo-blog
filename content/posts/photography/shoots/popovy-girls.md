In 2019, I dedicated a photoshoot to the [Popovy Dolls][1] who continue to be an inspiration of art. I put together a small team consisting of a makeup artist, hair stylist, and models who were intrigued by my vision. I took on the responsibility of photography, wardrobes, props, and final presentations. These are the results.

# Thanks!

This project was a labor of love with months of planning and decision making. From hair (+wigs), makeup, nails, clothes, and props. This was no easy task and not possible as a solo project. Many thanks to Erin Geer, Erica Cervantes, and Hugo Maldonado.
