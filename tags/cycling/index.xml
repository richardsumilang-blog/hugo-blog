      <description>&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but notice how beautiful the weather was today while returning home from brunch. The sky was a perfect blue, the winds were fresh but warm, and the sun was casting amazing shadows from the trees. One of those perfect weather day&amp;rsquo;s that you would kick yourself for staying in. As soon as I got home I pulled my bike out from the garage, wiped the spiders off, pumped up the wheels, and rode away. I always forget how happy it makes me to go out for a bike ride until I&amp;rsquo;m actually riding. So glad I did. :D&lt;/p&gt;</description>
