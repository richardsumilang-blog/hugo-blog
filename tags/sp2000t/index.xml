      <description>&lt;p&gt;The search for the perfect DAP continues! This journey began with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.richardsumilang.com/posts/electronics/astell-and-kern/sr25-mkii-review/&#34;&gt;A&amp;amp;K SR25 MKII&lt;/a&gt; and I suggest giving that a read first as this is part of a series and referenced at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, you&amp;rsquo;re probably wondering how I started at $750 DAP then jumped over 3x time the prices to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/367yKva&#34; title=&#34;Astell &amp;amp; Kern A&amp;amp;Ultima SP2000T Hi-Res Portable Player&#34;&gt;$2,500 DAP&lt;/a&gt;. I won&amp;rsquo;t lie, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t an easy pill to swallow but with enough time and effort, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably able to rationalize anything. When I took another look at the products out there, A&amp;amp;K still made the most the sense to me. I really like their locked in Android UI and what their DAPs have to offer. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3H5uusS&#34; title=&#34;Astell &amp;amp; Kern SA700 Portable Music Player (Vegas Gold)&#34;&gt;SA700&lt;/a&gt; in vegas gold really captured my attention for the next purchase. Unfortunately I found enough negative critisms for me to pass it up. If I was going to be paying so much for a DAP, at this point I figured I should look at whats the latest and greatest, and what has the most interesting features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where the &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/367yKva&#34; title=&#34;Astell &amp;amp; Kern A&amp;amp;Ultima SP2000T Hi-Res Portable Player&#34;&gt;SP2000T&lt;/a&gt; stood out from the rest of the lineup. I haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of a DAP with both vacuum tube and transistor amps built in. Not only did it let you select between tube or OP amp, it let you combine the two for for a warm yet accurate sound&amp;hellip; Well, at least according to the marketing material. At any rate, this was a technological masterpiece that was should be worth it&amp;rsquo;s asking price. Lets dive in!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
