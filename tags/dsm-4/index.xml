      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a best practice, it&amp;rsquo;s great great to have your data in more than one
location. I use my Synology Diskation as a local network file server at my home.
The reality is something can happen and I lose all my important data in that
little box. From a BBQ, a birthday party, or maybe the house just burns down and
now all my data is gone. Unfortunately my network rack at home will never be as
secure as a network rack in a data center. So, backup your data because that&amp;rsquo;s
much easier to do rather than trying to restore from no backup. Makes logical
sense right? Derp.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
