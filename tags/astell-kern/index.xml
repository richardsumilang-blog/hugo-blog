      <description>&lt;p&gt;I set out looking for my first DAP. I tend to look for the highest quality before the law of diminishing returns takes into too great of an affect. To me, this is the point where paying more only gives you a fraction more performance. Some would argue that&amp;rsquo;s where the magic is in audio equipment. (I&amp;rsquo;ll table that for another write-up.) Along with my bag of requirements are a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aesthetics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ergonmics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accessories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User Interface and Software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modern features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customer support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this search I found the &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/36ac5P0&#34; title=&#34;Astell&amp;amp;Kern A&amp;amp;Norma SR25 Portable High Resolution Audio Player&#34;&gt;Astell &amp;amp; Kern SR25&lt;/a&gt;. An absolutely beautiful device that seemed to check all the boxes. It was about the perfect size to be portable on walks. The system was android but it didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like a phone with a headphone jack. It felt like a device whose sole purpose was music. While researching the device, I found out the mk2 version was only a couple of weeks from being launched so I put my money towards that and waited. I was excited to have this new toy in time for the winter vacation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
