      <description>&lt;p&gt;After trying the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.richardsumilang.com/posts/electronics/astell-and-kern/sp2000t-review/&#34;&gt;A&amp;amp;K A&amp;amp;ultima SP2000T&lt;/a&gt;, there weren&amp;rsquo;t many other options that met my standard as to what I was looking for in terms of a user interface. I wanted something that locked me into a media player experience and not an experience that felt like  phone with audio outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only a few devices seem to catch my attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cayin N8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3h3gBkm&#34; title=&#34;FiiO M17 Music Player MP3/MP4 Portable Desktop High Resolution Android 10 THX AAA-788+ MQA 8X 3.5mm/6.3mm/2.5mm/4.4mm Bluetooth 5.0 aptX Adaptive Standby 1000h&#34;&gt;FiiO M17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/35bAwev&#34; title=&#34;Sony NWWM1Z Signature Series Hi-Res Walkman&#34;&gt;Sony NW-WM1Z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cayin N8 seemed like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3gX6DBc&#34; title=&#34;Astell &amp;amp; Kern A&amp;amp;Ultima SP2000T Hi-Res Portable Player&#34;&gt;SP200T&lt;/a&gt; with the ability to choose between tube and solid state. It has an asking price of $3,299 which would be the most expensive item on the list. The reviews I read on it are only great. My biggest issue with is the design, though completely subjective. To me, the physical design of this device looks like a late 1990s rendering of a player with heavy photoshop bevel effects. The interface itself looks pretty well dated too. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get past the mere aesthetics of this device for the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next on the list was &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3h3gBkm&#34; title=&#34;FiiO M17 Music Player MP3/MP4 Portable Desktop High Resolution Android 10 THX AAA-788+ MQA 8X 3.5mm/6.3mm/2.5mm/4.4mm Bluetooth 5.0 aptX Adaptive Standby 1000h&#34;&gt;FiiO M17&lt;/a&gt;. This was really interesting at a price point of $1,799 with the THX certification. I&amp;rsquo;ve listened to some THX systems done right before and they have been the creme of the crop IMO. They&amp;rsquo;re packing a lot of features in this device which also seems to be the biggest drawback for me. This device is borderline a desktop amp. From my research, it seems like a desktop amp that you can take on the go and thats not exactly what I&amp;rsquo;m looking for when I&amp;rsquo;m working in my shop and wanting a DAP in my pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally we have the &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/35bAwev&#34; title=&#34;Sony NWWM1Z Signature Series Hi-Res Walkman&#34;&gt;Sony NW-WM1Z&lt;/a&gt;. This is a 6 year old device coming in at $3,000. Looking at this device just screams sex appeal and the ergonimics look like a total win. The NW-WM1Z is  the premium version of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/33z6T6a&#34; title=&#34;Sony NW-WM1A 128GB Premium Walkman - Digital Music Player with Hi-Res Audio&#34;&gt;Sony NW-WM1A&lt;/a&gt; which I would&amp;rsquo;ve opted for if I could find a new one. But because these devices are so old, it was a miracle I could find a new &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/35bAwev&#34; title=&#34;Sony NWWM1Z Signature Series Hi-Res Walkman&#34;&gt;NW-WM1Z&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3h3gBkm&#34; title=&#34;FiiO M17 Music Player MP3/MP4 Portable Desktop High Resolution Android 10 THX AAA-788+ MQA 8X 3.5mm/6.3mm/2.5mm/4.4mm Bluetooth 5.0 aptX Adaptive Standby 1000h&#34;&gt;FiiO M17&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/35bAwev&#34; title=&#34;Sony NWWM1Z Signature Series Hi-Res Walkman&#34;&gt;Sony NW-WM1Z&lt;/a&gt; both look like they have an Android device due the footer navigation buttons on the player screens, but the Sony actually runs a homegrown OS. After experiencing the A&amp;amp;K daps, I wanted to get out of the Android experience completely and try the Sony&amp;rsquo;s warm sound signature. Lets dive in!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
