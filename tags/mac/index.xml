      <description>&lt;p&gt;My home network is wired through a Dell gigabit switch which is connected to my
AirPort extreme. Needless to say, this has worked well for me as the only
wireless devices connected are mobile devices. I decided to set up another room
in the house but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to go through the hassle of running wires through
the walls again. It&amp;rsquo;s undoubtably the best thing to do but this isn&amp;rsquo;t meant to
be permanent. I figured the next best thing to do is extend the network by
purchasing another AirPort Extreme. The hardware in it is better than an AirPort
Express plus I get a few ports to hardwire a few devices. My rule of thumb is
the less WiFi, the better.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re given a Windows network path such as \\Foo\Bar then that basically means connect to shared folder Bar on the server Foo. To do this, you can go Finder -&amp;gt; Go -&amp;gt; Connect to Server... and type smb://Foo/Bar which is the equivalent.</description>
