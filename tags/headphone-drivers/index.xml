      <description>&lt;p&gt;Headphones are essentially a set of tiny speakers that sit in, on or around your
ears and like all speakers, they have drivers. Everyone can agree that not all
headphones are the same or created equally. But besides the superficial
differences and the various features you may be offered such as noise cancelling
and wireless capabilities, there are other more subtle differences that can make
a huge difference. That subtle difference is determined by the type of driver
used in the headphones.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
