      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been exactly two years now since I’ve purchased my first &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/30i3CV5&#34; title=&#34;Leica Q 24.2 Megapixel Digital 35 MM Compact Camera&#34;&gt;Leica&lt;/a&gt;, the Q. It was right around this when I was going on a birthday trip to Mexico. I was a &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2BwEEHk&#34; title=&#34;Sony A7R III&#34;&gt;Sony A7R&lt;/a&gt; shooter and I believed then what I still do now: the Sony system is the most technological advanced system out there that delivered some of the sharpest results I’ve ever seen. But what it was lacking is what I was looking for in Leica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of trips around the world prior had me realize that I don’t want to be the person carrying around a backpack full of lenses and a large camera body. I wanted my family trips documented in the highest quality but at the same time what are supposed to be a trips of leisure and quality time shouldn’t feel like trips of added work&amp;hellip; Thus the search for smaller systems&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“Ooo hello there Matador Noir! Now that’s a good looking strap.” &amp;hellip; “What?!? $250!!! For a camera strap???” Yeah, those were my exact thoughts when I first laid my eyes on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vi-vante.com/camerastraps/matador-noir&#34; title=&#34;Vi Vante &amp;quot;Matador Noir&amp;quot; The World&#39;s Most Luxurious Leather Camera Strap&#34;&gt;“Matador Noir”&lt;/a&gt;. I glanced at a few pictures and thought &lt;em&gt;yeah, that&amp;rsquo;s pretty nice&lt;/em&gt;. Glanced at the price, sighed, and closed my browser tab. A year has passed since then and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vi-vante.com/&#34; title=&#34;Vi Vante designer leather camera straps and more&#34;&gt;Vi Vante&lt;/a&gt; camera straps have been my exclusive choice of leather on my &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2XXqZAm&#34; title=&#34;Leica M10&#34;&gt;Leica M&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/30i3CV5&#34; title=&#34;Leica Q 24.2 Megapixel Digital 35 MM Compact Camera&#34;&gt;Q&lt;/a&gt; bodies. But how did this happen? How did I let this seemingly overpriced looking brand take over my precious Leica collection?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
