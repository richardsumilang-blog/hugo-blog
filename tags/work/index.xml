      <description>Today marks day 1 of my journey at TMZ. There is an exciting energy in this environment. The first thing you notice is an open workspace where there is action going on every minute. (You probably already know that if you&amp;rsquo;ve watched the show before.) The technology is also very impressive. The team no doubt consists of nothing but A+ players. How else would TMZ have gotten to be so big in a short amount of time?</description>
