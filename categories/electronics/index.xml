      <title>Sony NW-WM1Z Walkman Review</title>
      <link>https://www.richardsumilang.com/posts/electronics/sony/nw-wm1z-review/</link>

      <guid>https://www.richardsumilang.com/posts/electronics/sony/nw-wm1z-review/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After trying the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.richardsumilang.com/posts/electronics/astell-and-kern/sp2000t-review/&#34;&gt;A&amp;amp;K A&amp;amp;ultima SP2000T&lt;/a&gt;, there weren&amp;rsquo;t many other options that met my standard as to what I was looking for in terms of a user interface. I wanted something that locked me into a media player experience and not an experience that felt like  phone with audio outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only a few devices seem to catch my attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cayin N8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3h3gBkm&#34; title=&#34;FiiO M17 Music Player MP3/MP4 Portable Desktop High Resolution Android 10 THX AAA-788+ MQA 8X 3.5mm/6.3mm/2.5mm/4.4mm Bluetooth 5.0 aptX Adaptive Standby 1000h&#34;&gt;FiiO M17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/35bAwev&#34; title=&#34;Sony NWWM1Z Signature Series Hi-Res Walkman&#34;&gt;Sony NW-WM1Z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cayin N8 seemed like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3gX6DBc&#34; title=&#34;Astell &amp;amp; Kern A&amp;amp;Ultima SP2000T Hi-Res Portable Player&#34;&gt;SP200T&lt;/a&gt; with the ability to choose between tube and solid state. It has an asking price of $3,299 which would be the most expensive item on the list and I&amp;rsquo;m already well over what I wanted to spend initially on this journey, ~$700 hah!. The reviews I read on it are only great. My biggest issue is the design, though completely subjective. The physical design of this device looks like a late 1990s rendering of a player with heavy photoshop bevel effects. The interface itself looks pretty well dated too. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get past the mere aesthetics of this device for the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next on the list was &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3h3gBkm&#34; title=&#34;FiiO M17 Music Player MP3/MP4 Portable Desktop High Resolution Android 10 THX AAA-788+ MQA 8X 3.5mm/6.3mm/2.5mm/4.4mm Bluetooth 5.0 aptX Adaptive Standby 1000h&#34;&gt;FiiO M17&lt;/a&gt;. This was really interesting at a price point of $1,799 with the THX certification. I&amp;rsquo;ve listened to some THX systems done right before and they have been the creme of the crop. They&amp;rsquo;re packing a lot of features in this device which also seems to be the biggest drawback for me. This device is borderline a desktop amp. It seems like a desktop amp that you can take on the go and thats not exactly what I&amp;rsquo;m looking for when I&amp;rsquo;m working in my shop and wanting a DAP in my pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally we have the &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/35bAwev&#34; title=&#34;Sony NWWM1Z Signature Series Hi-Res Walkman&#34;&gt;Sony NW-WM1Z&lt;/a&gt;. This is a 6 year old device coming in at $3,000. Looking at this device just screams sex appeal and the ergonimics look like a total win. The NW-WM1Z is  the premium version of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/33z6T6a&#34; title=&#34;Sony NW-WM1A 128GB Premium Walkman - Digital Music Player with Hi-Res Audio&#34;&gt;Sony NW-WM1A&lt;/a&gt; which I would&amp;rsquo;ve opted for if I could find a new one. But because these devices are so old, it was a miracle I could find a new &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/35bAwev&#34; title=&#34;Sony NWWM1Z Signature Series Hi-Res Walkman&#34;&gt;NW-WM1Z&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3h3gBkm&#34; title=&#34;FiiO M17 Music Player MP3/MP4 Portable Desktop High Resolution Android 10 THX AAA-788+ MQA 8X 3.5mm/6.3mm/2.5mm/4.4mm Bluetooth 5.0 aptX Adaptive Standby 1000h&#34;&gt;FiiO M17&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/35bAwev&#34; title=&#34;Sony NWWM1Z Signature Series Hi-Res Walkman&#34;&gt;Sony NW-WM1Z&lt;/a&gt; both look like they have an Android device due the footer navigation buttons on the player screens, but the Sony actually runs a homegrown OS. After experiencing the A&amp;amp;K daps, I wanted to get out of the Android experience completely and try the Sony&amp;rsquo;s known warm sound signature. Lets dive in!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Astell &amp; Kern SP2000T Review</title>
      <link>https://www.richardsumilang.com/posts/electronics/astell-and-kern/sp2000t-review/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 22 Jan 2022 21:15:45 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.richardsumilang.com/posts/electronics/astell-and-kern/sp2000t-review/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The search for the perfect DAP continues! This journey began with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.richardsumilang.com/posts/electronics/astell-and-kern/sr25-mkii-review/&#34;&gt;A&amp;amp;K SR25 MKII&lt;/a&gt; and I suggest giving that a read first as this is part of a series and referenced at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, you&amp;rsquo;re probably wondering how I started at $750 DAP then jumped over 3x time the prices to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/367yKva&#34; title=&#34;Astell &amp;amp; Kern A&amp;amp;Ultima SP2000T Hi-Res Portable Player&#34;&gt;$2,500 DAP&lt;/a&gt;. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t an easy pill to swallow but with enough time and effort, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably able to rationalize anything. When I took another look at the products out there, A&amp;amp;K still made the most the sense to me. I really like their locked in Android UI and what their DAPs have to offer. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3H5uusS&#34; title=&#34;Astell &amp;amp; Kern SA700 Portable Music Player (Vegas Gold)&#34;&gt;SA700&lt;/a&gt; in vegas gold really captured my attention for the next purchase. Unfortunately I found enough negative critisms for me to pass it up. If I was going to be paying so much for a DAP, at this point I figured I should look at whats the latest and greatest, and what has the most interesting features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where the &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/367yKva&#34; title=&#34;Astell &amp;amp; Kern A&amp;amp;Ultima SP2000T Hi-Res Portable Player&#34;&gt;SP2000T&lt;/a&gt; stood out from the rest of the lineup. I haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of a DAP with both vacuum tube and solid-state amps built in. Not only did it let you select between the korg tube or the OP amp, it also let you combine the two for a warm yet accurate sound in a hybrid mode&amp;hellip; Well, at least according to the marketing material. At any rate, this was a technological masterpiece that I thought would be worth it&amp;rsquo;s asking price. Lets dive in!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Astell &amp; Kern SR25 MKII Review</title>
      <link>https://www.richardsumilang.com/posts/electronics/astell-and-kern/sr25-mkii-review/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I set out looking for my first DAP. I tend to look for the highest quality before the law of diminishing returns takes into too great of an affect. To me, this is the point where paying more only gives you a fraction more performance. Some would argue that&amp;rsquo;s where the magic is in audio equipment. (I&amp;rsquo;ll table that for another write-up.) Along with my bag of requirements are a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aesthetics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ergonmics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accessories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User Interface and Software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modern features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customer support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this search I found the &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/36ac5P0&#34; title=&#34;Astell&amp;amp;Kern A&amp;amp;Norma SR25 Portable High Resolution Audio Player&#34;&gt;Astell &amp;amp; Kern SR25&lt;/a&gt;. An absolutely beautiful device that seemed to check all the boxes. It was about the perfect size to be portable on walks. The system was android but it didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like a phone with a headphone jack. It felt like a device whose sole purpose was music. While researching the device, I found out the mk2 version was only a couple of weeks from being launched so I put my money towards that and waited. I was excited to have this new toy in time for the winter vacation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What are In-Ear Monitors?</title>
      <link>https://www.richardsumilang.com/posts/electronics/audio/in-ear-monitors/</link>

      <guid>https://www.richardsumilang.com/posts/electronics/audio/in-ear-monitors/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In-Ear Monitors&lt;/em&gt; (IEMs), is a type of headphone designed to be partially
inserted into a user&amp;rsquo;s ear canal by using form-fitting tips often made by a
range materials such as rubber, soft plastic, silicon, and more. It&amp;rsquo;s also
common to purchase custom molded tips to fit your ear canal. This typically
offers the best results in comfort and noise isolation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The World&#39;s Finest Audiophile Electronics</title>
      <link>https://www.richardsumilang.com/posts/etc/work/losslesslife/the-worlds-finest-audiophile-electronics/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m very excited to announce &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.losslesslife.com/&#34; title=&#34;The world&#39;s finest Audiophile Electronics. Headphones, DACs, Amplifiers, reviews, and more.&#34;&gt;LosslessLife&lt;/a&gt;, a company focusing on the best
high resolution audio gear. LosslessLife reflects the continuous hard work
and commitment in the products it believes in by creating a voice to get the
word out from the audiophile communities and to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is often assumed by the average consumer that a higher price and/or bigger
brand name results in better product. While this can be true to some degree,
consumers are often paying more for a product&amp;rsquo;s marketing expenses when
purchasing from large retail stores rather than receiving higher performing
product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strict factors such as performance, output quality, and the overall
craftsmanship of products must be met in order to make it to LosslessLife as the
company name is synonymous with the highest level of quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a market that is saturated with mediocre products, LosslessLife believes it&amp;rsquo;s
success will be by educating consumers to make smarter choices when purchasing.
We do the research for you and provide &lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.losslesslife.com/&#34; title=&#34;Covering everything from high-end and audiophile headphones. Headphones and headphone amplifiers, accessories, how-to guides, and reviews.&#34;&gt;all of the facts&lt;/a&gt; in an unbiased
fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many companies sell products which they claim they would use, LosslessLife
only sells products it does use by it&amp;rsquo;s highly enthusiastic team with
backgrounds in technology, production, and an affinity for music.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What are Planar Magnetic Drivers?</title>
      <link>https://www.richardsumilang.com/posts/electronics/audio/planar-magnetic-drivers/</link>

      <guid>https://www.richardsumilang.com/posts/electronics/audio/planar-magnetic-drivers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A Planar Magnetic driver, has coined a few other terms such as &amp;ldquo;orthodynamic&amp;rdquo; or
&amp;ldquo;Isodynamic&amp;rdquo;, all of which mean the same thing (in regards to headphones). They
can be described as the child of a dynamic and electrostatic driver, sort of&amp;hellip;
The best of both worlds, at least.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What are Dynamic Drivers?</title>
      <link>https://www.richardsumilang.com/posts/electronics/audio/dynamic-drivers/</link>

      <guid>https://www.richardsumilang.com/posts/electronics/audio/dynamic-drivers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;dynamic driver&lt;/em&gt;, sometimes referred to as a &amp;ldquo;moving coil&amp;rdquo; driver is the most
common driver found in headphones. It is the same technology found in speakers
around your home, but on a much smaller scale. This type of driver
consists of alternating magnetic fields powered by a tiny wire coil (or a
&amp;ldquo;voice coil&amp;rdquo;). As the current changes based on the sound playback, the coil
reacts with the magnetic field and the lightweight diaphragm rapidly compresses
and decompresses the air by pulling the diaphragm in and out from the ring
within the driver to create the sound you hear.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What are headphone drivers?</title>
      <link>https://www.richardsumilang.com/posts/electronics/audio/headphone-drivers/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 05 Nov 2015 22:18:45 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.richardsumilang.com/posts/electronics/audio/headphone-drivers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Headphones are essentially a set of tiny speakers that sit in, on or around your
ears and like all speakers, they have drivers. Everyone can agree that not all
headphones are the same or created equally. But besides the superficial
differences and the various features you may be offered such as noise cancelling
and wireless capabilities, there are other more subtle differences that can make
a huge difference. That subtle difference is determined by the type of driver
used in the headphones.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bottlehead S.E.X. 2.1 Unboxed</title>
      <link>https://www.richardsumilang.com/posts/electronics/bottlehead/sex/unboxed/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 19 Sep 2015 18:45:10 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.richardsumilang.com/posts/electronics/bottlehead/sex/unboxed/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There you have it. All the parts that I&amp;rsquo;ll be assembling for the Bottlehead
S.E.X. version 2.1. The parts in the image include the impedance switch and the
C4S components. To the far left, there is a bag I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother unraveling
because it is mainly little screws and bolts that felt easy to lose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;build-order&#34;&gt;Build Order&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will do incremental builds. This way I can test the quality of a build on it&amp;rsquo;s
own before adding additional components. This is a good practice I follow in
daily software development and has proved helpful in debugging. The order will
be as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;S.E.X. kit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impedance switch installation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C4S Upgrade.&lt;/li&gt;

      <guid>https://www.richardsumilang.com/posts/electronics/bottlehead/sex/bottlehead-sex-journey/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After almost a month of waiting, my &lt;a href=&#34;https://bottlehead.com/?product=single-ended-experimenters-kit-2-1-for-headphones-sensitive-speakers&#34; title=&#34;Bottlhead S.E.X. kit for Headphones and Sensitive Speakers&#34;&gt;Bottlehead S.E.X.&lt;/a&gt; has finally arrived.
This will be my first of many electronic DIY projects. I will detail the journey
from start to finish. Including details like what tools I used, any problems
I encountered, and any suggestions I come up with on the way. This blog series
is sort of like an enhancement to the original guide provided with your

      <title>How to unlink Netflix from Panasonic Viera Cast VT25</title>
      <link>https://www.richardsumilang.com/posts/electronics/tv/panasonic/unlink-netflix-from-panasonic-viera-cast-vt25/</link>

      <guid>https://www.richardsumilang.com/posts/electronics/tv/panasonic/unlink-netflix-from-panasonic-viera-cast-vt25/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately you can&amp;rsquo;t on a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-TC-P58VT25-1080p-VIERA-Plasma/dp/B003N3BV5O&#34; title=&#34;Panasonic VT25&#34;&gt;Panasonic VT25&lt;/a&gt;. Someone managed to forget
about that feature on the Netflix app. Weird because it&amp;rsquo;s there for YouTube,
Pandora, Amazon, etc&amp;hellip; The only way you can is by resetting your TV to the
factory settings and starting from scratch. You&amp;rsquo;re wrong if you think you can
just log into your Netflix account and click the unlink all devices link from
your profile. On the plus side&amp;hellip; Never mind, there is no plus side.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
