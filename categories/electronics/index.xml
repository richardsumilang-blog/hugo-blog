      <title>What are In-Ear Monitors?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In-Ear Monitors&lt;/em&gt; (IEMs), is a type of headphone designed to be partially
inserted into a user&amp;rsquo;s ear canal by using form-fitting tips often made by a
range materials such as rubber, soft plastic, silicon, and more. It&amp;rsquo;s also
common to purchase custom molded tips to fit your ear canal. This typically
offers the best results in comfort and noise isolation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The World&#39;s Finest Audiophile Electronics</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m very excited to announce &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.losslesslife.com/&#34; title=&#34;The world&#39;s finest Audiophile Electronics. Headphones, DACs, Amplifiers, reviews, and more.&#34;&gt;LosslessLife&lt;/a&gt;, a company focusing on the best
high resolution audio gear. LosslessLife reflects the continuous hard work
and commitment in the products it believes in by creating a voice to get the
word out from the audiophile communities and to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is often assumed by the average consumer that a higher price and/or bigger
brand name results in better product. While this can be true to some degree,
consumers are often paying more for a product&amp;rsquo;s marketing expenses when
purchasing from large retail stores rather than receiving higher performing
product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strict factors such as performance, output quality, and the overall
craftsmanship of products must be met in order to make it to LosslessLife as the
company name is synonymous with the highest level of quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a market that is saturated with mediocre products, LosslessLife believes it&amp;rsquo;s
success will be by educating consumers to make smarter choices when purchasing.
We do the research for you and provide &lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.losslesslife.com/&#34; title=&#34;Covering everything from high-end and audiophile headphones. Headphones and headphone amplifiers, accessories, how-to guides, and reviews.&#34;&gt;all of the facts&lt;/a&gt; in an unbiased
fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many companies sell products which they claim they would use, LosslessLife
only sells products it does use by it&amp;rsquo;s highly enthusiastic team with
backgrounds in technology, production, and an affinity for music.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What are Planar Magnetic Drivers?</title>
      <link>https://www.richardsumilang.com/posts/electronics/audio/planar-magnetic-drivers/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A Planar Magnetic driver, has coined a few other terms such as &amp;ldquo;orthodynamic&amp;rdquo; or
&amp;ldquo;Isodynamic&amp;rdquo;, all of which mean the same thing (in regards to headphones). They
can be described as the child of a dynamic and electrostatic driver, sort of&amp;hellip;
The best of both worlds, at least.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What are Dynamic Drivers?</title>
      <link>https://www.richardsumilang.com/posts/electronics/audio/dynamic-drivers/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;dynamic driver&lt;/em&gt;, sometimes referred to as a &amp;ldquo;moving coil&amp;rdquo; driver is the most
common driver found in headphones. It is the same technology found in speakers
around your home, but on a much smaller scale. This type of driver
consists of alternating magnetic fields powered by a tiny wire coil (or a
&amp;ldquo;voice coil&amp;rdquo;). As the current changes based on the sound playback, the coil
reacts with the magnetic field and the lightweight diaphragm rapidly compresses
and decompresses the air by pulling the diaphragm in and out from the ring
within the driver to create the sound you hear.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What are headphone drivers?</title>
      <link>https://www.richardsumilang.com/posts/electronics/audio/headphone-drivers/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Headphones are essentially a set of tiny speakers that sit in, on or around your
ears and like all speakers, they have drivers. Everyone can agree that not all
headphones are the same or created equally. But besides the superficial
differences and the various features you may be offered such as noise cancelling
and wireless capabilities, there are other more subtle differences that can make
a huge difference. That subtle difference is determined by the type of driver
used in the headphones.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bottlehead S.E.X. 2.1 Unboxed</title>
      <link>https://www.richardsumilang.com/posts/electronics/bottlehead/sex/unboxed/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There you have it. All the parts that I&amp;rsquo;ll be assembling for the Bottlehead
S.E.X. version 2.1. The parts in the image include the impedance switch and the
C4S components. To the far left, there is a bag I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother unraveling
because it is mainly little screws and bolts that felt easy to lose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;build-order&#34;&gt;Build Order&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will do incremental builds. This way I can test the quality of a build on it&amp;rsquo;s
own before adding additional components. This is a good practice I follow in
daily software development and has proved helpful in debugging. The order will
be as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;S.E.X. kit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impedance switch installation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C4S Upgrade.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After almost a month of waiting, my &lt;a href=&#34;https://bottlehead.com/?product=single-ended-experimenters-kit-2-1-for-headphones-sensitive-speakers&#34; title=&#34;Bottlhead S.E.X. kit for Headphones and Sensitive Speakers&#34;&gt;Bottlehead S.E.X.&lt;/a&gt; has finally arrived.
This will be my first of many electronic DIY projects. I will detail the journey
from start to finish. Including details like what tools I used, any problems
I encountered, and any suggestions I come up with on the way. This blog series
is sort of like an enhancement to the original guide provided with your

      <title>How to unlink Netflix from Panasonic Viera Cast VT25</title>
      <link>https://www.richardsumilang.com/posts/electronics/tv/panasonic/unlink-netflix-from-panasonic-viera-cast-vt25/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately you can&amp;rsquo;t on a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-TC-P58VT25-1080p-VIERA-Plasma/dp/B003N3BV5O&#34; title=&#34;Panasonic VT25&#34;&gt;Panasonic VT25&lt;/a&gt;. Someone managed to forget
about that feature on the Netflix app. Weird because it&amp;rsquo;s there for YouTube,
Pandora, Amazon, etc&amp;hellip; The only way you can is by resetting your TV to the
factory settings and starting from scratch. You&amp;rsquo;re wrong if you think you can
just log into your Netflix account and click the unlink all devices link from
your profile. On the plus side&amp;hellip; Never mind, there is no plus side.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
